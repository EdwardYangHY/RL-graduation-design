#The codes are written by Haoyuan Yang for his graduation design: 
DRL's applications in optimal strategy problems
Southeast University, China

This graduation design is finished using python.
I used dynamic programming, reinforcement learning and DQN to solve the problem "crossing dessert",
a problem in 2020's nationl mathematical modeling contest. ( You can find the problem's statement in file "穿越沙漠题目.pdf")

Note that this design only contains solutions for problem number two, which consider a single player and uncertainty of weather.

Go to file "Map_3" for details for "第三关"

Go to file "Map_4" for details for "第四关"

Go to file "Chasing&Blocking" for an extra problem for multi-agent systems.
